 # Wordle

#### Introduction: 
I created this project for my COMP 110: Introduction to Programming and Data Science course at UNC-Chapel Hill in Fall 2023. The project features the same functionality as the New York Times' famous wordle game when run in the terminal. 

#### Tech Stack:
This project was created using Python and VSCode. 

#### Features:
The code takes in a user's guess (as long as it's 5 letters, no shorter or longer). The class wordle map is printed into the terminal with green, yellow, and white squares to give the user a hint about the correct word. The user can guess up to 6 times before they win or lose the game. 

#### Learnings:
This project taught me how to use basic Python when I started using the language. It also is a great example of printing to the terminal and a significant assignment coding a real game.
